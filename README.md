CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has
been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and
validation of autonomous urban driving systems. In addition to open-source code
and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings,
vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The
simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and
environmental conditions.

If you want to benchmark your model in the same conditions as in our CoRL’17
paper, check out

Roadmap
-------

We are continuously working on improving CARLA, and we appreciate contributions
from the community. Our most immediate goals are:

- [ ] Releasing the methods evaluated in the CARLA paper
- [x] Adding a Lidar sensor
- [ ] Allowing for flexible and user-friendly import and editing of maps
- [ ] Allowing the users to control non-player characters (and therefore set up user-specified scenarios)

Building CARLA
--------------

Use `git clone` or download the project from this page. Note that the master
branch contains the latest fixes and features, for the latest stable code may be
best to switch to the `stable` branch.

Then follow the instruction at [How to build on Linux][buildlinuxlink] or
[How to build on Windows][buildwindowslink].

Unfortunately we don't have official instructions to build on Mac yet, please
check the progress at [issue #150][issue150].
